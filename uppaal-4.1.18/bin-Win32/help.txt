Usage: verifyta [OPTION]... MODEL QUERY
where MODEL is a model file and QUERY is a query file.
If QUERY is missing it will be guessed.

Tuning options:
  -A  Use convex-hull approximation.
  -C  Disable most memory reduction techniques.
  -H n
      Set hash table size for bit state hashing to 2**n
      (default = 27)
  -n <0|1|2|3|4>
      Select extrapolation operator.
        0: Automatic
        1: No extrapolation (use with care)
        2: Difference extrapolation
        3: Location based extrapolation
        4: Lower/upper extrapolation
  -o <0|1|2|3|4>
      Select search order.
        0: Breadth first (default, -b too)
        1: Depth first (-d too)
        2: Random depth first
        3: Optimal first (requires -t1 or -t2)
        4: Random optimal depth first (requires -t1 or -t2)
  -S <0|1|2>
      Optimize space consumption (0 = none, 1 = default, 2 = most)
  -T  Reuse state space when several properties are examined.
  -Z  Use bit-state hashing.

Options for trace generation:
  -f prefix
      Write symbolic traces to files 'prefix-n.xtr' rather than to stderr.
  -t <0|1|2>
      Generate diagnostic information on stderr.
        0: Some trace
        1: Shortest trace (disables reuse)
        2: Fastest trace (disables reuse)
  -y  Display traces symbolically (post-stable).
  -Y  Display traces symbolically (pre- and post-stable).

Miscellaneous options:
  -h  Shows this help screen.
  -q  Do not display the option summary.
  -r seed
      Set seed for random number generator (default is current time).
  -s  Do not display the progress indicator.
  -u  Show summary after verification (incorrect for liveness properties).
  -v  Show version number.
  -x filename
      Save the (modified) system in XML format, in file 'filename'.
      If the system has been modified, an associated query file is created.
  -X prefix
      Save the symbolic trace in file 'prefixPropertynumber.xml'
  -p double
      lower (delta) probabilistic uncertainty.
  -P double
      upper (delta) probabilistic uncertainty.
  -a double
      probability of false negatives (alpha).
  -B double
      probability of false positives (beta).
  -E double
      probability uncertainty (epsilon).
  -i double
      threshold u0 for comparing probabilities.
  -j double
      threshold u1 for comparing probabilities.
  -w double
      histogram bar width.
  -c 0|1
      activate (1) or not (0) the SMC parametric comparison.
  -V activate SMC coverage.
  -R simulation resolution (pixels).
  -D discretization step size (time) for hybrid systems.
  -M activate Modest semantics for updates.
  -L filename
     logs the outcomes of the simulations for probability evaluations.
  -F double
     outputs to a file a sampling of simulations (when simulate is used).

The ordering of options is significant.

Environment variables:
  UPPAAL_DUMP_STATE          output a state satisfying the property.
  UPPAAL_DISABLE_SWEEPLINE   disable sweepline method
  UPPAAL_DISABLE_OPTIMISER   disable peephole optimiser
  UPPAAL_DISABLE_SYMMETRY    disable symmetry reduction
  UPPAAL_COMPILE_ONLY        write compiled model to stdout and stop
  UPPAAL_OLD_SYNTAX          use version 3.4 syntax

The value of these variables does not matter. Defining them is
enough to activate the feature in question.
